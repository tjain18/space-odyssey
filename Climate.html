                Global warming is defined as the gradual increase in the overall temperature of the Earth's atmosphere
                generally attributed to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, CFCs and
                other pollutants. The main reasons for global warming were:
            <ul>
                <li>Burning fossil fuels for production of electricity, petroleum caused emission of carbon dioxide in
                    atmosphere.</li>
                <li>Deforestation- Due to this CO<sub>2</sub> released in atmosphere was not absorbed by plants.</li>
                <li>Agriculture and farming- livestock like sheep and cattle, produce methane, a greenhouse gas</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            However as most of the human population was wiped out by 2025, so the main reasons for global warming were
            not these anymore. Temperature started to come back to normal as global warming reduced.

                AI became so powerful that they could control climate. AI enabled spacecrafts reached the asteroid
                belts, while on Earth the technology tame climate change.
                AI had built massive swarms of drones to reflect sunlight away from the oceans. As a result temperature
                of ocean reduced drastically hereby affecting climate all over the world. Green land submerged and it
                was beginning of pre ice-age era. Even countries like India was experiencing sub-zero temperatures. It
                was freezing in almost all parts of the world.

                The cold weather helped AI by keeping there processors cool. This increased their life.
                As we had entered into pre ice-age era there was no more agriculture possible. So there was shortage of
                food for people.
                Moreover humans cannot survive in such a cold weather. So many people died due to starvation and cold.
                They had to depend on robots for heat and food. This helped robots to takeover humans and rule them. So
                this climate helped robots in almost all aspects.
