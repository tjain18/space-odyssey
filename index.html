                After covid 19 was reported the world seemed to change forever. In few years most of the population was
                wiped off due to this deadly virus and only 20-25% of them survived. People started getting more
                dependent on AI. There was a great machine uprising. Each and everything even our household machines had
                been taken over by AI. They had replaced humans in almost all the fields. Gradually artificial
                intelligence (AI) started to become the dominant form of intelligence on Earth, with computer programs
                or robots effectively taking the control of the planet away from the human species. There was
                unemployment which lead to economic crisis which lead to conflicts among countries. Computer-integrated
                manufacturing allowed computers to control the entire production process. AI was able to modify its own
                source code and increase its own intelligence. AI started to conquer the world. In many parts of the
                world human had to surrender to them. They had built a strong network connection all across the world.
                Hiding anything from them was getting almost impossible. They could track down all the activities of a
                person. Art of developing machines was lost by this time. However guardians who went for hibernation in
                2020 possessed this art. Only they can help us win the war against AI by destroying their network.
